# Development and Contribution Guidelines

- Refer to the main [README.md](mdc:README.md) and [docs/README.md](mdc:docs/README.md) for setup, build, and contribution instructions.
- All documentation content should be placed in the appropriate chapter subdirectory under [docs/](mdc:docs/).
- Images should be stored in [docs/images/](mdc:docs/images/) and named according to the convention: `chXX-figYY.png`.
- Scripts for content processing are located in [scripts/](mdc:scripts/).
- Follow Markdown best practices and keep content clear and concise.
- When adding or editing chapters, update the sidebar in [docs/_sidebar.md](mdc:docs/_sidebar.md) if necessary.
