## What People Are Saying

> "Sebastian has a gift for distilling complex, AI-related topics into
> practical takeaways that can be understood by anyone. His new book,
> Machine Learning Q and AI, is another great resource for AI
> practitioners of any level."? ""Cameron R. Wolfe, Writer of Deep
> (Learning) Focus

> "Sebastian uniquely combines academic depth, engineering agility,
> and the ability to demystify complex ideas. He can go deep into any
> theoretical topics, experiment to validate new ideas, then explain
> them all to you in simple words. If you're starting your journey
> into machine learning, Sebastian is your guide."? ""Chip Huyen,
> Author of Designing Machine Learning Systems

> "One could hardly ask for a better guide than Sebastian, who is,
> without exaggeration, the best machine learning educator currently in
> the field. On each page, Sebastian not only imparts his extensive
> knowledge but also shares the passion and curiosity that mark true
> expertise."? ""Chris Albon, Director of Machine Learning, The
> Wikimedia Foundation

> "Sebastian Raschka's new book, Machine Learning Q and AI, is a
> one-stop shop for overviews of crucial AI topics beyond the core
> covered in most introductory courses"¦If you have already stepped
> into the world of AI via deep neural networks, then this book will
> give you what you need to locate and understand the next level."?
